# Heart Disease Prediction by Machine Learning

## Overview
### This project utilizes Python coding, leveraging the power of popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn for machine learning. The goal is to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various clinical parameters and attributes.




#### *Dataset Attributes:*
id: Unique identifier for each patient.
age: Age of the patient in years.
origin: Place of study.
sex: Gender of the patient (Male/Female).
cp: Chest pain type ([typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal, asymptomatic]).
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital).
chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results ([normal, stt abnormality, lv hypertrophy]).
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
exang: Exercise-induced angina (True/False).
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
thal: Types ([normal; fixed defect; reversible defect]).
num: The predicted attribute.




#### *Three classification models were employed:*
1- Logistic Regression

2- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

3- Random Forest

Additional techniques applied:
Hyperparameter Tuning
Feature Importance
Confusion Matrix
Cross-Validation
Precision, Recall, F1 Score
ROC Curve
Area Under the Curve (AUC)
Evaluation metrics were calculated using cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV.



#### *Dependencies:*
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn



#### *Usage:*
Clone the repository and run the provided Python script to execute the heart disease prediction models. Customize the models, parameters, or dataset as needed for your specific use case.
